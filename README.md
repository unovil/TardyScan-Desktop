# Tardy Scan - Desktop Port

This project is currently in development, to be used (currently) at Pasig City Science High School.

This is an app that simply fetches student tardiness records from a database.

## Family

The android port can be found here: https://github.com/unovil/TardyScan-Android

## But, why do this?

There are a few reasons behind creating a project like this. Here are the top reasons:

* I was approached by my Grade 9 Math teacher, saying that if I do this successfully, I would be exempted from written works for the rest of the SY.
* I can (hopefully) get royalties when having this implemented at other local schools.

## Todos

* ~~actually do something significant with the project loooool~~
* make an installer for the app
* add authentication

## Contributing

stay tuned for this!
